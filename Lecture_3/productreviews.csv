Two month-long trips abroad: this is the best. It take a little while to get used to the smaller keyboard, but once you do, it works flawlessly. The charge lasts a very long time (3 months they say), no problem not recharging it for 5+ weeks of constant use. Solid, looks good, and protects the iPad.  I couldnt survive without it. I havent tried any others, but I am sold on this one.
This is nearly as heavy as my laptop and I was hoping to find something lighter for travel, but it works well anyway.
Wonderfully thin, light, and durable. The keyboard works extremely well for me. My *only* wish about this is that the angle was not quite so steep when open - or perhaps adjustable. If I hold it on my lap, with the front edge of the keyboard at my navel, that tilts it to an acceptable angle. If using it on a keyboard tray or table, I put a post-it pad or similar item under the front edge to put the view angle to something more sensible. But overall this is MUCH nicer vs the keyboard / cover Id been using.
This Keyboard/case cover is Absolutely FABULOUS!!! It works so well and it so convenient and stylish... im the envy of all of my friends. Some have even mistaken the combo of my Ipad 3 and this keyboard for a netbook and are amazed when im able to (so easily and quickly) change postions from horizontal to vertical and then snap on the magnets to cover/close my ipad 3 and on the go in seconds. I also love how the outer aluminum casing matching that of the ipad... and even if you add a skin (like i did) it still looks very professional and classy/sleek with Apples original design. Im a college student and this very versatile product has been really amazingly helpful (easy to type on) and efficient with taking notes in class and in helping me to use my Ipad 3 as a netbook at times and also to detached and use is solo as it was originally intended. Very versatile amazing product! :) I have highly recommended this to others, though, it does most of the selling itself!!! ;)  <3 Ps: My only con is that the Ipad isnt as secure in this keyboard/device in the vertical position as it is horiztonally. It seems that it only clicks into postion with a locking secure feel in the horizontal position. If they were to maybe add some center magnets to the keyboard docking area/slot... i think it would lock into place and function more securely (since being vertical makes the ipad 3 too top heavy for the keyboard.) Additionally, my keyboard did actually fall out/back and down from the keyboard docking area when in vertical position before... but i think it had to do with the pressing of my fingers on the ipad while in vertical position (not a problem in horizontal position). If you are going to touch your screen a lot and type i would suggest the horizontal position; But if you just plan to type without the touching on the screen i think the vertical position should work fine. :)
Great case! Easy to use, thin, and turns my iPad into a MacBook!
The cover is cool ... the keyboard is a little tight but SUCH an improvement over the screen keyboard. The screen sits securely & at an angle that makes it far more useable than with the smart cover I used before. Suddenly, Im shifting a lot of work from my computer to my iPad, and able to be more portable than ever. This one kicks the iPad up several levels for useability & sheer pleasure.
The keyboard I received was clearly used or refurbished.  The box had already been open and torn, there were smudge marks and dirt on the packaging and scratches on the keyboard.  My order stated NEW. I am very concerned that I have to write a letter to receive a refund for a clearly mistaken or fraudulent practice of sending used items while I paid for a new item.
I purchased this keyboard to pair with the 2nd generation Nexus 7. Its very well thought out, and I love that the case becomes a stand. This is very preferrable to the Amazon Basics bluetooth keyboard that comes with a cheap little stand to prop up your tablet. I also find it to be worth the extra money for Win8 compatibility vs. the Android 3.0+ only version. The only solution I think Id prefer is a small cover keyboard like the ones sold for the iPad Mini, but Im not holding by breath, and this at least gives the experience of a nearly full sized keyboard. Pros: Easy to use Adjustable viewing angles for tablet Win8/Android 3.0+ compatible Pleasant key strike Well thought out cover/stand Cons: A bit on the heavy side for a portable keyboard Not a very quite keyboard. Everyone in our operations meeting at work can definitely hear my typing away Significantly more expensive than other Bluetooth keyboard options Would be nice if the keyboard locked into the cover somehow Overall the pros far outweigh the cons for me.
1) Its easy to set up. 2) It looks a little bit thick. 3) It cant protect the whole ipad mini.
This item is excellent, easy to use, works perfectly, theres no doubt about it, if you need this ... Buy it, you wont regret it.
This is the second keyboard I bought for mi iPad Mini and its just the best option. So light, beautiful and precise. Logitech really knows. I had other reference for an iPad 2 and its still working.
The name of the product misguided me to think its an iPad air protective skin, had to return it with baring the delivering fee by myself. Terrible product information presenting.
This is a great Keyboard and cover... couldnt be more happy with my purchase.
Just what I needed. A keyboard that really works and lets me type reasonably normally for my tablet. A key broke after about 10 months. Logitech asked for pictures and a mailing address and I had a brand new one in under a week. A great product from a great company.
slides out
Its hard to tell the features apart from the shortcomings, frankly. They keys are small. They have to be. They QAZ keys are right up against the left edge, so you will find your left hand slowly drifting rightward, away from the edge. But, its good enough for touch-typing with some practice. Much better than touch-typing on the screen or on those Blackberry keys. The slot for holding up the mini is pretty solid and stable, and has a touch of magnetism that requires you to twist the mini a little bit to make it come off. I wish it could be further back, but Im thinking that would make it more tippy. So, again, not ideal, but, by necessity, good enough. The screen and the keys do end up being a bit too close together for comfortable typing. If you are typing anything long, you will want a separate stand. For portability, I recommend the Daffodil IPC140, which is just sturdy enough to hold up the screen, and is super light, which means its not sturdy enough for touch-screen gaming. There are many other stands that work better if you dont need light weight. The magnets are on the weak side. The cover may flip open, or just come off, if you drop the whole thing, so its not fantastic as a protective cover. Its more of a scratch-protection cover for sticking it in a purse; my purse has a pocket just the right size, and I also got a Neoprene case. The keyboard does not flip to the back of the mini. You can lay it flat with the mini, or take it apart and put the mini into the slot. If you want to put the mini on another stand, you have to take it off the keyboard. Fine for my purposes. Battery life seems to be as advertised. What would be really nice is if the keyboard and the mini could be charged on one cable, instead of two, but they are seldom charged at the same time, are they. Its pretty light for what it does. Im impressed.
very nice product. Its very tight and compact, light weight and easy to type with if you are interested in a keyboard the size of your ipad. Great price as well. Great purchase, it its what your looking for.
Ill start off by saying that Ive had the 1st gen iPad since the day it was released (which has now been given to the kids), and now I own a new iPad that I picked up the day it was released.  In all the time Ive owned an iPad, Ive jailbroken several times, picked up some non-keyboard peripherals, etc...  Ive NEVER felt the need to own a keyboard for the iPad, until one day....   A co-worker came in with his iPad 2 and showed me this awesomely thin and light keyboard.  At first, I wondered why anyone would own a keyboard and then when I realized how great this keyboard fit with its magnets and how it completely changed the look and feel of an already perfect device (the new iPad), I was almost instantly sold.   About 2 weeks later, I got one for my b-day and I have now had it for almost a full month.  Here are all the positives and negatives I could come up with while using it during this time frame: + Very thin and light.  You really need to hold it in your hands to believe it. + The aluminum shell compliments the iPad beautifully and makes the whole thing look like a brand new Apple product + The keyboard is as big as it can be and still fit within the confines of the iPads size. + The key response gives you a confident on/off type of feel whenever a key is pressed.  Theres no question youve hit a key when you hit it. + The amount of shortcut keys is amazing.  I cant find anything I would want added! + Being able to copy/paste by using standard Mac keys is so underrated and thankfully you can do that here + The strength of the magnets is much more than I expected.  I love being able to grab the top of my iPad and be able to move the whole thing without the keyboard falling out from under it + You can use any micro USB charger you have hanging around to charge it.  Not sure about you, but I HATE proprietary connectors with an undying passion : ) + I have yet to have a single disconnect with the Bluetooth connection.  How do they do that?!?! - The charging cable it comes with is just a really short (2 feet or so) cable that you can either plug into your PC to charge it, or plug it into a USB power adapter that you may already have.  If you have neither, youre going to have to spend a few bucks just so that you can charge it. - There are no rubber/felt feet in the package.  You will want to go to a hardware store and buy a variety pack of sliders/feet and try out which one you like best.  I finally settled with 4 rubber feet that are about a millimeter thick and about a half-inch in diameter. - Its a bit of a hassle to open your iPad with this keyboard attached.  I remedied this by getting a SoundJaw for my iPad.  It not only completely fixes the backwards-facing speaker on the iPad, but also serves as an absolutely perfect handle for opening it!   I use my iPad as my primary computer, so I use this keyboard at least 2-4 hours a day on average.  I have played with other keyboards and although the non-attached full-size keyboards are much better for typing (as they should be), the problem Ive always had is their portability.  My problem is that I knew that if I ever got a keyboard that wasnt always somehow attached to the iPad, Id end up barely using it.  I dont want to have to go through a set up process with having to prop up my iPad and then sit at a table and on and on.  This little bad-boy fits the bill perfectly for me and if you are the same type of user as I am, theres no reason not to own one of these.
This keyboard is a perfect match for ipad. Looks and works great! But have in mind what youll get is a keyboard that also serves as a cover. Dont expect it to be a real cover for the ipad. It will be useful when carrying the ipad  in short distances. Another drawback is that it is a little cumbersome when you are standing and have to show something to someone. Youll have to fit the ipad on the keyboard magnets and it is a little awkward. The magnet is the biggest problem of this keyboard. The magnet that hooks the ipad in order to close it as a cover is not sooo strong. It is not as strong as Smart Case magnets. Sometimes they detach from each other. Nevertheless, it is not that weak and does a good job. So, one more time: it is more a portable keyboard than a cover. And that is exactly when youll love it. It is perfect for a meeting or a classroom. You can type on it almos as fast as in a real size keyboad. Keys feel great. And it is a really classy keyboard. So... it is perfect for work and classes. Not so good for interteinment applications. If working is the main use for your ipad, go for it.
It is great protection when traveling.  But other reviewers are right, the magnet is NOT as strong on the one for the Air, as it is for my iPad 3
Would not function well with iOS7
Good: 1. Works with my Samsung Galaxy SIII 2. The keys feel good 3. Syncing was easy Not so good: 1. A little small, so your fingers might overreach keys at first 2. the case that comes with it doubles as a stand which is great for tablets but useless for phones.
Likemany people, Ive used Logitech products for many years. Some have been good, others not so good. Their keyboards are usually well made in my opinion. This keyboard is no exception. Im typing this reiew on it right now, and its much faster than any touchscreen keyboard. Im personally not a fan of touchscreen keyboards, so this accessory is a must have for people like me, if you intend to do any significant amount of typing. The keyboard paired up immediately with my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tablet. The keys are low profile but have good response. It also has directional keys and special function keys built into the number row at the top. The board is thin and very light, but feels well made and not fragile. Typing on it is a breeze. The top is rounded and thicker, to provide a slight angle when the board is resting on a table, or your lap. This is also one of the shortcomings. There are no adjustments available for a steeper angle. Logitech should have built in some flip-down legs that fold into the chassis to provide that option. I suppose they didnt in order to maintain a very slim profile. The other thing that you should be aware of is the repeating speed of the delete key. The longer its held down, the faster it deletes. Hold it down too long and youll be erasing full lines very quickly. After doing that a few times, youll quickly get in the habit of tapping the key rather than holding it down to correct typos. I dont know of any way to change the speed setting. Its very portable and has a nice faux leather covered hard case/sleeve to carry it. It does not lock in, so be aware of this. The case opens up and turns into a stand (again, there is only one angle available.) Despite any nitpicking about the shortomings, I highly recommend that tablet owners who want a physical keyboard, consider this one. It runs via bluetooth, so youre not limited to using it just with the tablet. It would make a fine addition to an HTPC given its size an weight. However, it does lack a touchpad. So youre stuck with the cursor keys if you use it with a non-touchscreen deice. For the purpose it was created, this keyboard is a good piece of hardware.
I find that tucking the flap behind and against the iPad works best while using my iPad on my lap. I dont like using my iPad upside down, but that is actually the most comfortable position with this case. There are a lot of choices; in the standard open case mode with the iPad bottom resting in one do the two positioning groves, I find works best on a table or desktop for viewing. With the flap folded behind the iPad, its solid on a table or on my lap when the tablet is upside down. Also a great position for typing while on my lap. Turn the tablet around and I have infinite positioning on my lap, but not so stable on a table. I find it to work as well as any case Ive used, and iced had my fair share of cases for this tablet. One of the nicest feature is the ability to close it securely and have the magnetic flap lock it closed for carrying. I dont find any fraying or signs of use. I dont think its heavy at all, its not the lightest case Ive used but my lighter cases dont add the protection this one dose. I dont find it difficult to swivel into portrait mode and it sort of snaps into place which ever mode I turn it too. It feels solid, secure, comfortable, and positions are nearly limitless. My only complaint is that the flap, when folded behind the iPad in upright position, doesnt have a way to hook onto the back to keep it from sliding. Otherwise, I think its a really nice, professional looking case.
Im Getting used to this fab keyboard/cover. Ill get a lap desk so I can play, read, etc.  Any suggestions?
I am so glad to have found this keyboard. Because  it makes it easy for me to use my iPad, I no longer carry with me my MacAir laptop when I travel. It also serves as a protective cover.
In fact I hesitated a lot when trying to decide to buy this keyboard or the keyboard case. But because I have already purchased an iPad leather case in the first place, I chose this one. Logitech makes this keyboard much better than I expected, the stand is great and of high quality. Pros: 1. It is made really of high quality. It looks so good and feels nice when you type. 2. I believe the function keys are sufficient. 3. More flexible than the keyboard case. You can put your iPad on the stand on a table, while you yourself lean back comfortably in an armchair or in a couch. 4. If you have a iPad case not suitable for a portrait view as I have, this stand will count for the flaw. Cons: 1. Sometimes when I type really fast, the keyboard tend to lose one or two letters. 2. The keyboard uses 4 AAA batteries. 3. The folding and unfolding of the stand takes a little bit effort because the buckles a little bit stiff.
The product is ok but I find it hard to stay connected via Bluetooth to the iPad. It keeps disconnecting
ahhh battery life if pretty terrible -  I should have bought the solar one.
I am very pleased with this keyboard - its strudy, well made and the keyboard action is excellent.  It works well with my iPad Mini - the set-up (pairing) was totally uncomplicated and automated - it is, in my book, a 10!
Fits the iPad mini 2 perfectly and keeps my iPad safe from scratches etc. I am a very careless user and I keep throwing the iPad around, but this case has taken all the hits so far and kept the iPad good. The material is kinda nice and doesnt show off the dirt. I like it the tilted view very much as I use the iPad for watching videos on my bed.
I adore this keyboard! I had purchased a low end one over a year ago and when it refused to charge the battery I went hunting for a better solution. I can honestly say this is a fabulous board. The keys are large and each is textured so my fingers really know they are on the keys. I took it to a conference and used it effortlessly for 4 straight days. I love the fact that the charge lasts months. Thank you so much for selling this model!
Absolutely love this case. Its very modern and has a great keyboard size. The keys itself are big enough for you to type like a normal person. This was well worth the money. Everyone always compliments me on my case. I see a lot of people with those big bulky leather cases with the strap in the front that looks hideous. The cover is actually made of a very durable material. I have had it for a little over 2 months and I am very very happy with this.
This thing is really nice ! its light , easy to setup. Love the angle the ipad sits on. Love it with my iPad 3 . The keyboard has a laptop feel and looks great when being used or when closed. its a buy.
Nice quality keyboard. The non-adjustable angle of the tablet does not allow for a thin shell type case to be installed. Angle is significantly steeper with a iPad mini retina, due to the retinas additional thickness. Wishlist item: Make the slot cover adjustable so a thin shell type case works with the keyboard.
One of my colleagues has this same keyboard. What can I say, I had to go out there and purchase my own. The casing is durable, made from a synthetic plastic that wraps all around the device. The bluetooth keyboard is built very well and can last about 30 days on 1 charge. Although this is not the keyboards fault or logitechs, the keyboard is a bit small for people with big fingers. It takes a little bit of getting use too, but once you do, it is a pleasure to play with. The case and the keyboard is still small enough (about the size of 120 page soft cover book) and is super light. Great for traveling and writing. A MUST if you are planning on traveling and blogging.
I charged this a month ago and it is still running off of first charge. It is great.  It charges on a USB from your computer. I am using it for an IPAD but you need a USB to charge it so you charge it off of a regular computer.  It works really well. It also seems to make the IPAD more sturdy for transport. It was a great purchase and a good value. I would highly recommend.  It is kind of tight as it is only the width of the IPAD, but any keyboard you would buy would be like that I imagine.  I researched a lot before my purchase.
I know a good Bluetooth keyboard is not cheap, because I had previously purchased Logitech 920-003390 Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0 Plus for my Galaxy tablet.  That keyboard is a standalone, which means I have to tote it separately, so I was grateful to have the opportunity to test this all in one case and keyboard. The case has a sort of rubberized feel to the outside of it (not leather), whereas the interior (keyboard, stand, and corner mounts) is hard plastic.  This construction makes the Folio really lightweight and, I expect, durable, as well as providing good protection against knocks and bumps in a backpack or bag.  My guestimate is that it weighs approx as much as the Galaxy, so adding this to the tablet approx doubles the weight.  Thats still pretty lightweight to carry around a tablet, case, and keyboard. The Folio anchors the tablet via the top corners, and a long bar across the bottom center edge.  This bar is what flips out to make the stand. It clips magnetically to the keyboard half with a magnet is so strong that you can pick up the top of the tablet and the stand will stay attached, but this also means the screen angle is not adjustable.  However, because of the rigid solid plastic anchor points, there is no flexibility in this case for other Galaxy models (ie: it does not fit my 10.1 Tab Pro).  None. The keyboard paired easily with my Galaxy. It has its own rechargeable battery built-in and does not drain from the tablet. It is really nice to type on--keys have a nice tactile feel with the right bounce and pressure.  About the only issue is that the compressed size of the Folio (to fit the 10.1 screen) means the keyboard is not quite full-sized like my standalone Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, but I found it easy enough to adjust to it after some use. In conclusion, I think this is a very well-crafted, sturdy, accessory for the Galaxy Tab 4.  It is a bit pricy, but considering that you get a brand name (come on, you know Logitech has been making great keyboards forever) Bluetooth keyboard and a case, plus the convenience of an all in one, I think thats justifiable.
I purchased this case in red at the Apple store (though mine has a grey interior unlike the blue shown in the pictures).  I went to the Apple store intending to buy their smart case.  I did not like that when holding it in your hand (such as on the couch relaxing), the Apple smart cases back hung and flapped around.  The tech actually suggested Velcro! The only other case for the iPad Air they had in the Apple store was this one (it is the same model as the one with keyboard, just without the keyboard).  Ive been very happy with it.  I would like if it lay flatter when folded back (a slight annoyance) which is why I deducted one star.  I agree with another commenter that this case really shines in landscape mode, but is a bit lacking for portrait mode when holding in hand. The material is fantastic.  It feels like a very tight nylon woven fabric.  The clips hold the air firmly inside and I have no fear it will slip.  I love the on/off auto function (a bonus I found when I got home).  The stand works very nicely when sitting in my lap lounging on my couch (another unexpected feature).  The other cases with folding covers that make the stand wont sit nicely in your lap (theyre made for a flat surface).  Since this case still has the entire cover to sit on, it can sit nicely on a chair, my lap, or even my cat in my lap. Im surprisingly happy with this case.  I vastly prefer it to the leather Apple smart case (which was my original intention to buy).  It looks better too!
Works great and holds the Ipad at the proper angle to see the screen with little glare.
This is a fantastic keyboard.  I had the same one for my iPad3.  The magnet is stronger on this iPad Air version so it doesnt come apart in my briefcase as often as the iPad3 version did.  The best feature of this keyboard is that it gives you an integrated keyboard without the bulk of the folio-type keyboards.  This one fits easily in my purse and I never take the iPad without it.
It fits well and protects my iPad. I would recommend this brand. Affordable price and the color was great. Awesome!
Easy and useful.  Not sure why I waited 3 years to get this for my IPAD 2....Only down side is there is not a readout to tell you when battery is getting low but I love it anyway
This is a very nice product.  The keys are responsive and the keyboard itself feels very solid.  The case for the keyboard is sturdy and makes an excellent stand for the iPad, even with the ipad in its cover.  Id definately recommend this product.
This case has worked well. I love that you dont have to charge it. The keyboard works well and the cover protects the device.
So Ive been reading reviews in search of the best keyboard for my iPad 2. Its been pretty hard because Ive had my eye on the Logitech for the past few months but kept reading about the magnet issues, glue in the slot issue, not staying closed issue, glossy fingerprint issue, etc. I decided to just buy it and check it out myself. What a great keyboard!! The form factor is amazing! It feels like its supposed to be part of the iPad when closed and the magnet in the slot to keep the iPad secure is GREAT! The keyboard keys feel very nice. I actually prefer it over the Zagg Pro Plus (which I purchased as well and may be going back). Regarding the other issues, I can say that I dont have a problem with the iPad and keyboard not staying closed. Im not sure when that would be an issue, but for me its not a problem at all. If Im going out with it, I bought an iLuv neoprene case (which is PERFECT too! iPad and Logitech fits snuggly) and put it in there. Stays closed in the case and keeps it protected. Yeah it would be great if it had a magnet on the opposite side of the magnetic bar, but again not an issue for me at least. Regarding the strip in the slot that comes off, I cant comment on that yet. Hasnt happened to me but Ill keep an eye out for it. Im just being careful of how I remove the iPad from the slot - I tilt it towards me and then lift it out vs. pulling it out straight up and out from the slot. Glossy fingerprint magnet - well, I have the white edition and its not really an issue. Ill be getting the iCarbons carbon fiber skins to cover it anyway so it wont be an issue at all. All in all, I really love this keyboard. It feels right at home when closed up with the iPad and looks great together when the iPad is in the slot. Im still trying to decide on this and the Zagg Pro Plus. I think the Zagg is probably going back. Pros: - great form factor - nice and light and feels good in the hand when together - keys feel great. Not too loud and clicky and very responsive - magnetic slot is great and holds the iPad securely Cons: - magnetic strip could be a little stronger - hasnt been an issue for me. I would not have known it to be an issue if I didnt read some of the complaints - could be a little more solid - but then it probably wouldnt be so nice and thin.
This is a very nicely made product. Small, but not too small. Sadly I sent it back. It would not stay married to the Android tablet. This is a dedicated Android keyboard.  It took about 10 minutes of working with it to get it to connect. Worked all right for a while. I shut it and the tablet down for the night. The next day, after fooling around for 10/15 minutes couldnt get  a stable connection. I believed the tablet to be alright and tested it with my Lenovo Yoga S. It hooked up immediately and after I shut down the computer then restarted, it grabbed the keyboard so quickly that I was able to finish the reboot sign-on (Win8) with the Logitech. It would appear that Google/Android needs to do some system work with the Bluetooth end.
I purchased this knowing that it might not work for my SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 2 SGH-i497 10.1 but decided I would try it anyway. Low-and-behold it DID work, it fit tight and did exactly what I wanted it to... until a week after it arrived, the spacebar died. Pros: Nice design with a clean look Easy to use Cons: Did not hold up to very light use. In conclusion, I would not recommend this item. (the return was quick and easy)
My wife wasnt sure she was going to use this much but now never uses her ipad without it. Not only does the keyboard help out tremendously it makes having an ipad on your lap that much easier.  Plus it provides a perfect protection for your screen when you close it.
I am really sick of cheap rubber or just poorly made keyboards that break or have me slamming my hands into them just to make a few sentences appear... finally something has come along that is made not in rubber, cheaply, and is super responsive to my touch. The only true downside to this folio is that there is no latch to keep it closed, but you can work around that issue... and maybe Logitech will come out with a 2.0 version with a latch at a later time. Overall I am very happy with this folio and keyboard but have broken down my pros and cons here for easy viewing: Pros: ~Very durable keyboard- not cheap feeling and unresponsive to touch ~Overall folio weight and thickness (3/4 thickness) is not too much of a difference when I compare them to my heavy duty Belkin Cinema Folio Stand even with a keyboard ~No extra wires needed to charge keyboard ~Fast solar charging speed- it even charges in dim light for late at home office working ~Two viewing angles ~Open/close auto on/shutdown Cons: ~No latch to close properly- BUT this can be fixed with some creative ideas. I was being a little lazy and took a jumbo rubber band (the really big and thick ones I use for arts and crafts) to hold it shut for now. But I have read in another review ways that you can get really creative to fix this issue ~No warning for when the battery is about to die ~Solar panel for charging located at the bottom- I feel that it should be at the top for when it is in use ~A little on the high price but you do get what you pay for- a keyboard and folio that is not cheaply made
Great 2nd Samsung product purchased, Better than expected for a refurbished item......very fast with no problems at this time.
Not as good as the previous generation keyboard for my iPad but still a good buy!
What can I say? This sturdy keyboard and iPad cover works exactly as advertised, it is easy to set up (I.e., make the Bluetooth connection), easy to use (i.e., the keys are well designed and responsive) and serves as a good cover. The arrow keys solve the problem of moving the cursor when one wants to type elsewhere on the screen.
But it needs function keys.  Cant do F1 F2, etc. so its great for android, but if you want to also use it for Windows, you may run into issues.
It is smaller in size that I originally thought, but this is a good thing. The descriptions are accurate to what I received. I am using this with a Samsung Tab 2 10.1. Item syncd easily once my tablet recognized there was something out there to sync with. Keyboard functions like I would hope to. Looking to purchase one for the wife now...
Love it!  So sleek, so smart!  The magnetic suction was awesome!  It completes the ipad and is something I cannot live without!
Very Good!
Nice, quality case.  This is now the case I use on my ipad air.  Previously I had the stock apple cover but switched to this one as it is more sturdy and the stand works better.  It looks classier also.  Fits great and it seems to be a quality product and is very nice looking.  I would definitely recommend it.
I love this thing!  I am using it right now and I would not leave home without it again. Bluetooth feature works great, snaps together and stays together really well.  Solidly built too
I bought this on a whim hoping it would pair with my android phone running gingerbread version 2.3.4 even though the guy at Best Buy said it wouldnt. And guess what, it did. The android specific keys even work. If you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone I highly recommend the keyboard, especially because it comes with the stand.
Light, durable and nice looking cover. I have been using it for about a month now  and I still love it
It does what it aims to do; is easy to set up; looks good.  I got it supplied at a very good price too.
Excellent product for iPad. We love it. Do reccommend to buy one for iPad. It will be easier to type words.
I tried 3 different keyboards on Amazon and for the price, this one was the best! I dont have any complaints about it and would definitely recommend this to a friend. It is a quality keyboard for a great price! It is thin, lightweight, and best of all is that it has the magnetic strip in the crease where you would stand your ipad is VERY USEFUL! The other two did not have this and what a pain it was, the one with a kickstand (Anker) kept falling down and seemed very cheap. Get this one, you wont regret it.
This keyboard really increases the functionality of the tablet, making it almost into a laptop.  Typing on this is so much better than the screen keyboard.  It is well-made, stylish, and protects the tablet well when closed.  I am really quite delighted, and would have given it 5 stars, except for these minor shortcomings: 1) despite pictures, it only holds the tablet in the horizontal position, 2) it only holds tablet at one fixed angle, and is not adjustable, and 3) the edges at the bottom of the keyboard are a little obtrusive. These aside, I am very pleased and glad to have it. Use it all the time, including for this review.
Works and fits perfectly.
I had a couple of cases I had purchased for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, that werent living up to my expectations.  In the past I have purchased many Logitech products and was familiar with their quality and durability.  The Case I received was no exception. It holds the Tab firmly in place and the keyboard functions flawlessly.  I travel frequently on business, so protecting my tablet is important to me, and the case does a great job.  I would highly recommend this case to anyone.
I love using this. But I dont use it often.y schools are not MAC compatible much. so this doesnt help me that much. Because I have to use my laptop for things I type. If your school is very MAC compatible go for This great purchase. Slim. And has a stand/case.
A disadvantage (you decide the degree) of the iPad is the lack of a true keyboard, but this keyboard works great!  I type on various keyboards all the time from my 13 laptop to normal 110-key keyboards to ergonomic keyboards.  This one is noticeably smaller (obviously, it has to conform to the iPads form factor) than even the 13 laptops keyboard, but it is still quite usable.  I especially appreciate the Apple-specific keys and the iPad home button key.  It syncs to the Bluetooth connection very easily.  Battery life is fantastic: I charged it full about a week ago (with the included micro USB charging cable) and with moderate use have found no need to recharge yet.  Perhaps best of all, the keyboard quickly clicks into place and makes a nice looking shell, putting the iPad to sleep and ready for transportation.  The Logitech keyboard cover allows me to type as needed on the iPad with the same speed and accuracy to which Im accustomed on other keyboards and looks nice as a cover, too!
This keyboard transformed my iPad!  I love to use it.  There is a tiny delay for it to link up after it hasnt been used in a few hours.  Not a big deal at all, maybe 5 seconds.  It clicks into place with the magnet strip very nicely to make a cover, but just be careful with it.  It is not intended to protect your iPad.  If you need to protect it, you may need a sleeve to put it in.  I am addressing comments negative reviews had made.  I wouldnt have been bothered by either of these issues.  I am SO happy with this purchase. Also, it is very lightweight.  I had another keyboard before (it was more of a protective cover and keyboard combo).  It was too heavy for my taste.  Took away the purpose of having a tablet.  This one is divine!
I like this keyboard a lot! I dont use it daily or anything, just occasionally when I need to type a longer email or something on my iPad and I dont want to get out my laptop. If youre looking for a keyboard for your iPad, this one works great! It also attaches to your iPad if you want it to serve as a cover as well.
Feels very sturdy, and the keys are like any other Apple keyboard. The space that holds the iPad up is sturdy and I dont feel like the device will topple over. Ive had no issues with the Bluetooth connectivity, either. Its thin and can be stored alongside your iPad in a sleeve without issue.
Im about a month into my experiment to see if an iPad can take the place of a laptop. This keyboard works great and makes an adequate cover for the iPad. I wouldnt let it slide around in my car without some kind of sleeve to hold it together in the event of a major jolt. It fits in the  map pocket behind the passenger seat and that works for me. Otherwise toss it in your luggage, briefcase or folio and youve got a great mobile browsing and word/spreadsheet rig. Ive never been a good typist - 5-finger at best while staring at the keyboard. What I love about the Logitech paired with the iPad is when I flub a word, it gets underlined, I tap on it and select one of the 3 suggested words. On the Mac, Ive got to double-tap the word and retype it. Really no dislikes. I havent had to charge it since the initial charge 5 weeks ago, and Im not a stickler about turning it off when not in use. The magnet is strong enough to hold the weight of the keyboard when lifted by the iPad, but not vice-versa. The iPad will come loose if you pick up by the keyboard and turn it over too far.
I got this for my wifes Toshiba Thrive tablet.  She is very happy with the keyboard and she was able to get it to connect without any assistance from me.  The only thing that she was neutral about was the case; she thought it was nice, but not really needed.  Still, theres no real drawbacks to the keyboard and she is very happy with it.  This is important because she tends to get impatient if her electronics dont work quickly and easily. These reasons, along with the happy wife part, were why I gave the keyboard 5 stars; nice keys, easy to connect, and reliable operation.  Since it hasnt seen a lot of extended use, I cant comment on the battery life.
The case is brushed silver and matches the iPad perfectly. It feels sturdy but not overly heavy. Durable enough to provide a good level of protection to the screen, but the back is exposed.  I took a chance and connected it to an iPad 3 and it works seamlessly. It took less than 2 minutes to pair them and the directions were easy to follow. If I were to nit pick Id say the chord for charging could be longer but its not that big a deal. I have small hands so this fits me fine and meets my needs perfectly.
Its better than soft keyboard, but iOS lacks of support for keyboard. Better to know what you need before buying.
The keyboard is great and is very easy to type on.  Its a little smaller than a regular keyboard, so takes some getting used to, but that didnt take long!  The key punch easily and feel like a regular keyboard.  The hard back is nice and protects my iPad screen.  The only thing I dont like is that it seems like the magnetic part that holds it together comes apart sometimes.  Also, when using it to hold up my iPad, I have to make sure the iPad is in there just right or else the iPad falls off.
This product is best and looks so stylish. Very sharply made and fits good with my ipad air. Thanks  A+++++++++++++++++++++
Ive been using the case and keyboard for about a month and am really pleased with it.  The keyboard took a little getting used to, but not much.  Was at a conference last week and the case was invaluable to taking notes in meetings. The folio does add some weight, so I limit use of this case to times when I plan to do a fair amount of typing.
I just love this keyboard. Super simple to set up via iphone and ipad. Bluetooth works quickly and has a good range. Its not the slimmest or lightest wireless keyboard out there, but its still well within the portable boundaries. The case/stand is super handy. The keys are soft and well laid out. Only one downside to this is: With the ability to switch to different keyboard languages on Aplpe products, the iOS keyboard software is expecting the corresponding phisical keyboard lay out. Example, if you were to type on a computer in a foreign country, you would notice that the keybord letters, numbers and particularly special char, are not in the same location as your american keyboard. So when you switch the iOS device to a foreign keyboard, the software is expecting that corresponding lay out. which of course this keyboard doesnt have. So it makes it hard to find out where the right char would be in lieu of the american one. This is very easily worked around it but simply typing in the foreign language using the american keyboard setting (if its a language that accepts the same alphabet, so not russian, chinese, etc). Other than this, i would highly raccomed this keyboard. Especially for the price. :)
I like this product. My ipad is stable and secure on it and the magnet holds well. I just wish, as I do with all new technology that I buy, that it came with instructions. I dont know how you can tell when the battery is low and it would be nice if there were some kind of an indicator light or something that would show that the charge it low. Overall though, it is a good product. Not too heavy, keyboard set up like others and the magnet works well.
It is great.
The Logitech Ultrathin Magnetic Clip-on Keyboard is just that....it has an aluminum back finished to match the rear of iPad Air, and attaches magnetically:  both for use with the keypad, and as used as a case.  Setup is easy.  Remove the cover (if applicable) from your iPad, insert the iPad into the slot just above the keys on the keyboard, and it is magnetically held in place.  To close the cover, you must remove the keyboard by lifting it out of the slot, lifting up the rear hinged cover, and inserting the iPad at an angle, then lowering (when the cover holds the iPad on with a magnet.  With the keyboard in place, the face is protected, but the rear is not.  Bluetooth connection is fast, easy and reliable.  The keyboard has a semi-clicky, tactile feel, and is easy to type with given its diminutive size.  The stand holds the iPad securely, and provides a good viewing angle (its adjustable).  The keypad acomes with a USB cable for charging, and a single charge is said to last up to 3 months. If you need a keyboard for your Air, and dont mind leaving the rear of the iPad unprotected from stratches, adding 6.4mm to the thickness and 2/3 to the weight of your Air, then consider this solid keypad!
This is truly an amazing little keyboard.  I have no trouble typing on it and my hands are far from small.  I can use it alongside of my case crown case for ipad, or I can set the ipad in the keypad and the magnets hold it firmly.  The color purple is nice as I have every thing else in white, red or blue.  My ipad is white so it is a great combination.  All I can say is nice and worth the money.
I bought this to accompany my husbands new iPad mini on business trips. I figured he could just take it along on his trips and leave it aside when hes at home and just browsing the internet. He loves it so much that its always attached to his mini! It makes a perfect stand and he can still easily browse the internet with it on. I typed a paper for English on it when my Macbook pooped out and while it took a second to get used to, it ended up being just fine. My husband couldnt believe I was using it for a long paper, but I really wasnt uncomfortable at all. If I had to complain at all, its a really minor inconvenience to detach both parts to close it up or to put the iPad in the stand area. It also would be nice if the whole thing flipped the opposite way so if you did want the keyboard out of the way, you wouldnt have to detach it.
I cant believe I lived so long without this for my ipad mini. It really does turn my iPad mini into a mini computer. I am able to utilize my whole screen which basically makes the screen area larger than a regular iPad once you take up a 1/3 of your screen with the iPad touch keyboard.

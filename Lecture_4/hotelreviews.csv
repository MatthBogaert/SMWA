Clean, quiet, close to trainstation. No service, no facilities, bad neighborhood.
Nice comfortable clean room, good bed, good airconditioning which is needed in mid summer! Excellent location a few minutes walking from Termini. We rented bikes around the corner and from there it was very easy to see the entire city. There's also a bus stop on the doorstep and a lot of public transport from Termini. There was some food left in the private fridge, probably from the previous travellers. Some minor unfinished details in the bathroom (some knobs missing in the tub, no toilet roll holder).
Elegant room and bathroom, the ceiling with exposed brick is marvelous. The check-in process can certainly be improved. Only the day before it was notified to me to check-in before 6pm to avoid a 50€ penalty fee, the email could have been more professional, luckily I barely made it. Also I had no instructions on the Inter-phone to buzz. I had to make an international call to be checked in on the phone, a different procedure from what was described in our previous communication. Other than that the place is excellent!
The owner Andrei was wery friendfull and he make us an upgrade to a superior room. 
Large and well appointed room with nice architectural details. Great location near Termini.
Top of the top! We stayed in an apartment in Piazza del Popolo, we loved our stay, the place is clean and beautiful! Near by the most important attractions in Rome! Definitely suggested!
The location of this hotel is perfectly convenient!
It was pretty, clean with a Netflix account. I needed more Shampoo.
Excellent location, facilities, comfort. Nicola was super friendly and helpful, the perfect host. The room was clean, quiet at night and incredible value. Highly recommended!
The host is great and very helpfull. Our ask about early check in was resolved. It is important to feel really welcomed. Nicolo suggested some good restorants, sightseeing points and useful up to date recomendation.which I was not aware off and was in touch for any questions. Very clean room,cleaning and changing towels were every day. Great matress and choice of pillows. Very quite at night, sound protection from neighbors. Location is great. Definetely recommend and will try to stay next time.
Thanks a lot for the wine bottle and room upgrade! The service was really nice, the owner of the place was very helpful. We loved our stay, the room was cosy, clean and sweet. Location is awesome, everything is in the walking distance. Definitely check out the Cathedral nearby, it is incredible, and the Street Panisperna for super nice and tasty places for dinner and the best ice cream we've had in Rome in Glauco. We would comeback and can recommend the place! There could be a little bit more soap for the hand washing (since current times require being extra careful and wash hands multiple times).
Nicola is a fantastic host - extremely helpful and went over and above to make sure our stay was fantastic! We had a deal which seemed "to good to be true" on paper as it was a really reasonable price and yet so well placed as a location but there were no surprises... just a fantastic room perfectly situated so close to Roma Termini station which was excellent to get to and from the airport and the place was just as advertised - a lovely room and really great hosting from Nicola. As the hotel is only for pre-booked rooms, it is not signposted so people won't randomly walk in off the street, this just means you need to be patient as a few days before you arrive Nicola will be in contact to clarify precisely how to access the building and ensure that the check-in goes smoothly. The room we stayed in - 401 - was lovely with a brand new bathroom and great bed!
Great location, short walking distance from Roma Termini. Complete sound proof and private entrance to apartment. Nicola is an amazing host and will make sure you will enjoy your stay.
Very nice host.
Not easy to find but if you follow instructions you shouod find this guesthose without problemem.
100% recommended. Really nice room in a great location close to all the great locations of Rome. The owner was very helpful and friendly.
Perfect location, super clean the room and very comfortable. I was impressed how kind is the owner of the place! Definitely I’ll recommend to all my friends! Next time in Rome for sure I’ll stay there again.
Amazing place, very kind and helpful owner Andrea. A little bit noisy air coinditioning (although it is off). But we definitely come back in case of staying in Rome again.
Beautiful apartment in a great location, the owner was very kind and professional, he waited for me despite my delay. Well recommended!
The location was good. Walking distance to many sites. It’s very safe given it’s on the same block as a police station. I liked the size of the apartment. The two rooms were helpful for the 4 of us.
I didn’t like the fact that location of the apartment wasn’t clear on booking.com. We ended up walking to another location and had to cab it to the apt after speaking with owner. Also, the host doesn’t know what people need with their stay. Soap? Bring your own, soap, shampoo, hand soap…. Kitchen trash can was tiny and missing one leg. No dishes. The two glasses we found were dirty…. Forks and knives were garbage and unorganized. Forget about using kitchen. It’s simply doesn’t have anything organized. There are random items throughout the cabinets and drawers. Bathroom doesn’t have trash can. No towel hooks or rack. It’s these little things that are missing. But they make a big difference when we are staying for a few days and need to wash my hands but need to run down to the store to buy soap.
